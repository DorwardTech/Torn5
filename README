Torn 5 is a laser tag tournament scores manager. 

It is a complete rewrite of Torn 4 (available from http://dougburbidge.com/Apps/index.html ) in C#.

I'm using SharpDevelop 4.4 as the IDE, and targeting .NET 4.0.

It aims to eventually include most or all of the functionality of Torn 4, and to offer better web reports.
